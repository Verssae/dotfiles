# Verssae's dotfiles
These are my dotfiles 😆

![screenshot](images/screenshot.png)

## Shell setup (macOS)
- [Fish Shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell)
  - I use __fish__ instead of _zsh_.
  - `fish/config.fish`
- [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
  - I use __FiraCode__
- [Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
  - A modern replacement for `ls`
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship) 
  - I customize starship theme based on `Nerd Font Symbols` preset
  - `starship.toml`
- [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)
  - I use [OneHalfDark](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) colorscheme.

## NeoVim setup
My nvim setup is cloned from [craftzdog/dotfiles-public](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public) (This repo is very cool, thanks ! 🙏🙏🙏)

The differences are:
- [vscode.nvim](https://github.com/Mofiqul/vscode.nvim)
  - This is a VSCode-like vim-code-dark color scheme. Very awesome !
- [NeoFormat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat)
  - I use it instead of prettier for code formatting. It supports many LSPs.
- [copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim)
  - I'm a big fan of Copilot 👍
- Other LSPs...

## To-do
- [ ] Describe full setup process for quick install
- [ ] Support other OS platforms
